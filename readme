	Syntax:
		void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
		Parameters:
			s: Pointer to the block of memory to fill.

			c: Value to be set. It is passed as an int, but the function fills the memory using the unsigned char conversion of this value.

			n: Number of bytes to fill.

		Return Value:
			Returns the pointer s.
		Common Uses:
			Initializing arrays:
				int arr[10];
					memset(arr, 0, sizeof(arr)); // sets all bytes of arr to 0
				Setting structures to zero (for clean initialization):
					struct MyStruct s;
					memset(&s, 0, sizeof(s));
